1. Working together
In your teams, discuss, and write a plan for, and set up the following:

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE: 
Where will you store your scripts? 

	Git remote repository (James) and cloned to both team member pearcy home directories   


	File structure:
		big_data_practical
			scripts

Where is the raw data?
	/OSM/CBR/AF_DATASCHOOL/input/2019-04-12_Transcritome>

What about intermediate analyses?
	
How do the project directory structures we have used previously (e.g. 
for R work) map to CSIRO's High Performance Computing?

GIT/GITHUB: 
How will you collaborate on code?
	Separate scripts for nidividual work
	A project script for bringing together separate parts
	A shared readme	
Who will work on which bits, and when? How often will you commit? 
How often, and when, will you push? 
Will you each keep local copies of a remote repo? 
	If so, where will your local copies be? 
Where will you keep a record of the workflow you decide on?

README: 
Do you need a README file?
	Yes; set up a file inon local machines with git version control 
and 
What will you put inside it?
